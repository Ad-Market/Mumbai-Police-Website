        <h1> OUR HISTORY</h1>
<h2>DID YOU KNOW THE MUMBAI POLICE FORCE IN ITS EARLY AVATAR WAS FORMED BY A UNIT CALLED THE BHANDARI MILITIA.
System of modern policing in Mumbai began with the establishment of a Police Out-post by the Portuguese in 1661.

Later in the year 1669 when the East India Company acquired Mumbai, Gerald Aungier became the Governor of the City and is considered the founder of the city's present Police Force. He organized the Bhandari Militia with Subhedars head quartered at Mahim, Sewree and Sion. He died at Surat in 1677.

During John Child's Governorship (1681-90) in the year 1682 there was only one ensign for the whole force of 500 militia, and of non-commissioned officers there were only three sergeants and two corporals.
</h2><h2>
On February 17, 1779, Mr. James Tod was appointed as "Lieutenant of Police" on probation with an allowance of Rs. 4 per diem and on March 3rd of that year he was sworn in to office. Tod had a chequered career as head of the Bombay Police. Tod's regulations, which numbered 41, were the only rules for the management of the force which had been passed up to that date in a formal manner. He had twice been indicted for felony and had been honorably acquitted on both occasions: but he still lived in continual dread of blame.

On March 29th, 1780 the office of the Lieutenant of Police annulled and office of Deputy of police on fixed salary of Rs. 3000/- a year created in its place. On April 5th ,1780 Tod formally relinquished his formal office and was appointed as Deputy of Police. Subsequently his designation was changed to "Deputy of Police and High Constable". Three years later, in 1790, Tod's administration came to an inglorious end. He was tried for corruption.

In the year 1793, Act XXXIII, Geo. III was promulgated. The post of Deputy of Police and High Constable was abolished and in its place post of Superintendent of Police was created. Mr. Simon Halliday was the first Superintendent of Police. He was in-charge of his office until 1808. He had made a thorough revision of and re-arrangement for policing, the area out side the Fort. The troublesome area known as "Dungree and the Woods" was split up into 14 Police divisions, each division being staffed by two constables (European) and varying number of Peons (not exceeding 130 for the whole area), who were to be stationary in their respective charges and responsible for dealing with all illegal acts committed within their limits.

The first Deputy of Superintendent was Mr. James Fisher, who continued office until the date(1808) of Mr. Halliday's retirement when he was succeeded by Mr. James Morley.


The Right Honorable, the Governor in Council, under the provisions Indian Police Act XIII of 1856, had appointed Mr. W. Crawford as the Commissioner of Police for the "Town & Island of Bombay", 13th. October, 1856. He was permitted to continue to perform his duties as Senior Magistrate of Police, also. Messrs. C. Forjett & W. H. Dunlop were the Deputy Commissioners. On 4th November, 1856 Mr. W. Crawford, Commissioner of Police, Bombay had issued public notice, notifying the whole of the clauses embodied in Section LXXXI. of Act XIII. of 1856 declared to be applicable all public streets, roads, through - fares, and places of public resort within the town and Island of Bombay.

In the year 1864, the posts of Senior Magistrate of Police and Commissioner of Police were sagregated and Mr. N. Oliver was appoined as the Senior Magistrate of Police. Mr. Frank Souter took over as the independent Commissioner of Police on 14.11.1864. He remained in his office due to his professionalism and popularity for a record period of 24 years (14th November, 1864 till 3rd July, 1888). He laid the foundations of glorious traditions for the City Police Force, which are proudly  maintained even today.
The Office of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai, was formally moved in 1896 to the present magnificent building built in the Anglo-Gothic style of Architecture and continues there till date. The first Indian Officer was also inducted in 1864.
</h2><h2>
However, it was not until Aug 15, 1947 that an Indian headed the police force. Charge was officially handed over by commissioner A.E. Caffin, the last British officer to J.S. Bharucha on Independence Day.
